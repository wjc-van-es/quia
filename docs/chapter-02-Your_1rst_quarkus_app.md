# 2 Your first Quarkus application

## Attempt at using the CLI tool to create an application
Without specifying the `-P 3.5.0` for the BOM
`quarkus create app nl.vea:quia --extension resteasy-reactive` let to a pom file that settled for version `3.8.6`
This however could not be build with `mvn clean package`:
`Could not find artifact io.quarkus:quarkus-rest:jar:3.8.6 in central (https://repo.maven.apache.org/maven2)`
Adding Redhat repo's to the pom file didn't work, settling for BOM version `3.8.5` or the `3.5.0` versions in the book
didn't work either.

---
### Note
- I temporarily added [https://maven.repository.redhat.com/ga/](https://maven.repository.redhat.com/ga/) as dependency
and plugin-dependency repository to the project's pom.xml, but this didn't help and any dependency found was downloaded
from maven's default `central` not `red-hat-enterprise-maven-repository`
- Instructions in
[https://docs.redhat.com/en/documentation/red_hat_build_of_quarkus/3.8/html-single/developing_and_compiling_your_red_hat_build_of_quarkus_applications_with_apache_maven/index#proc_online-maven_quarkus-maven](https://docs.redhat.com/en/documentation/red_hat_build_of_quarkus/3.8/html-single/developing_and_compiling_your_red_hat_build_of_quarkus_applications_with_apache_maven/index#proc_online-maven_quarkus-maven)
suggests to temper with ~/.m2/settings.xml, but I prefer everything to be configured in the project's pom.xml
to prevent any "works on my machine" exceptions. so I placed the repo for both plugins and regular dependencies there.
see: https://maven.apache.org/guides/mini/guide-multiple-repositories.html
- see for available quarkus extensions:
[https://repo.maven.apache.org/maven2/io/quarkus/quarkus-rest/](https://repo.maven.apache.org/maven2/io/quarkus/quarkus-rest/)

Comparing the created pom with the ones in the https://github.com/xstefank/quarkus-in-action revealed several 
differences most notably `<quarkus.platform.version>3.14.1</quarkus.platform.version>` a far more advanced version
and the dependency `io.quarkus:resteasy-reactive` being absent from the repository's pom.

Now `mvn clean package` worked fine.


## ยง2.3 Running the Quarkus Application with `mvn quarkus:dev`
- We could run quarkus with maven from the maven tool window, but as this is a long-running process, it is probably
more convenient to run it from a dedicated terminal.
- However, we must not forget to ensure Java 21 being set in that terminal, whereas the Java default on our laptop is
  still Java 17.

### setting a fixed environment with SDKMan! with `sdk env`
- Open a terminal in the project root (where the `pom.xml` is situated)
- check the current Java version, which will be the default with `sdk current java`
- look up the available Java 21 version with `sdk list java | grep tem`
- Change to the Java 21 version with `sdk use java 21.0.4-tem` This will change the java version only for this terminal
- Now create an `.sdkmanrc` file with `sdk env init`,
  - which will contain the line `java=21.0.4-tem`, because this was already set in the terminal with the 
    `sdk use java 21.0.4-tem` command
- Now next terminal starting in the project root with the `.sdkmanrc` file can be set to the right environment with
  `sdk env`
